# Plant_Disease_Detection
This is an end-to-end application that allows users to upload images of their plant leaves and it classifies the image into healthy or diseased categories.

There are three main components of this project.
1) CNN: I've trained a convolutional neural network for the task of image classification using a dataset obtained from Kaggle.
2) Tensorflow Serving and FastAPI: Tensorflow Serving is a flexible and high performing serving system for ML based models, utilised to serve the saved model.
   FastAPI is a python web framework for creating APIs which are really fast and can handle large number of HTTP requests simultaneously.
3) Frontend: I've created an interactive frontend using HTML and CSS to make it super easy for users to upload images and get results for their plant leaves.
